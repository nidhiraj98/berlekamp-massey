Underwater wireless information transfer is of great interest to the military, industry, and the scientific community, as it plays an important role in tactical surveillance, pollution monitoring, oil control and maintenance, offshore explorations, climate change monitoring, and oceanography research. Underwater Wireless Optical Communication (UWOC) is preferred as it provides higher data rates than the traditional acoustic communication systems with significantly lower power consumption and simpler computational complexities for short range wireless links. UWOC has many potential applications ranging from deep oceans to coastal waters. However, the biggest challenge for underwater wireless communication originates from the fundamental characteristics of ocean or sea water. For this reason, encoding of messages is necessary to protect the integrity of the transmitted messages. With a proper and efficient encoding and decoding scheme, errors can be detected and corrected without loss of information. This report discusses the study of the Extended Binary Golay G(24,12,7) encoder and decoder via simulation of the UWOC channel on MATLAB. Further, the implementation and the corresponding observations of the same on an Arduino and Raspberry Pi platform have been discussed. This is followed by the analysis of the (31,11) BCH code and hence, the justification of choosing BCH codes over Golay codes for Underwater Optical Communication Systems.
